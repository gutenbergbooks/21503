<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>FURTHER NOTES ON THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</h3>

  <p>The following remarks are supplementary to a note on the hippopotamus
  in Vol. ii, p. 35. In that note the exhibition of the hippopotamus at the
  Roman games is not traced lower than the time of the Emperor Commodus.
  Helagabalus, however, 218-22 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, had
  hippopotami among the various rare animals which he displayed in public
  as a part of his state. (Lamprid. c. 28) A hippopotamus was likewise in
  the vast collection of animals which were prepared for the Persian
  triumph of Gordian III., but were exhibited at the secular games
  celebrated by the Emperor Philip in the 1000th year of Rome, 248 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> (<i>Capitol. in Gordian. Tert</i>., c. 33.) In
  the seventh eclogue of Calpurnius, a countryman describes the animals
  which he saw in the Roman amphitheatre, among which is the
  hippopotamus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Non solum nobis silvestria cernere monstra</p>
      <p>Contigit; æquoreos ego cum certantibus ursis</p>
      <p>Spectavi vitulos, et equorum nomine dignum,</p>
      <p>Sed deforme genus, quod in illo nascitur amni</p>
      <p>Qui sata riparum venientibus irrigat undis."</p>
      <p class="i12">VII. 64&mdash;8.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Calpurnius is generally referred to the time of Carus and Numerian,
  about 283 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>; but his date is not determined
  by any satisfactory proof. (See Dr. Smith's <i>Dict. of Ancient Biog. and
  Myth</i>. in v.)</p>

  <p>There is no trace of a live hippopotamus having been brought to Europe
  between the time specified in the last of these testimonies and the
  middle of the sixteenth century. When Belon visited Constantinople, he
  saw there a living hippopotamus, which had been brought from the
  Nile:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"L'animal que j'ai veu vivant à Constantinople (he says), apporté du
  Nil, convenoit en toutes marques avec ceulx qu'on voit gravez en diverses
  medales des Empereurs."&mdash;<i>Observations</i>, liv. ii. c. 32. fol.
  103. b. ed. 1564.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Belon returned to Paris from the Levant in the year 1550. In his work
  on fishes, p. 17., he speaks of another Frenchman, lately returned from
  Constantinople, who had seen the same animal. (See Schneider on <i>Artedi
  Synonym. Piscium</i>, p. 267.) P. Gillius likewise, who visited
  Constantinople in 1550, saw there the same hippopotamus, as he states in
  his description of the elephant, Hamburg, 114. (Schneider, <i>Ib.</i> p.
  316.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent, <span class="sc">Mr. G. S. Jackson</span> (Vol.
  ii., p. 277.) controverts the opinion expressed in my former note, that
  none of the Greek writers had seen a live hippopotamus. He thinks that
  "Herodotus's way of speaking would seem to show that he was describing
  from his own observation;" and he infers that the animal was found at
  that time as far north as the Delta, from the fact, mentioned by
  Herodotus, of its being held sacred in the nome of Papremis. But, in the
  first place, it does not follow that, because the hippopotamus was held
  sacred in the Papremitic nome, it was found in the <!-- Page 458 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page458"></a>{458}</span>Nile as low as that
  district. In the next place, there is nothing in the words of Herodotus
  to indicate that he had seen the object of his description. (ii. 71.) On
  the other hand, the substance of his description tends strongly to the
  inference that he had <i>not</i> seen the animal. It is difficult to
  conceive that any eye-witness could have described a hippopotamus as
  having the hoofs of an ox, with the mane and tail of a horse. His
  information as to javelins being made of its skin was doubtless correct,
  and he may perhaps have seen some of these weapons. Cuvier conjectures
  that the original author of the description in Herodotus had seen only
  the teeth and some part of the skin of the real hippopotamus; but that
  the other particulars were taken from a figure or description of the gnu
  (<i>Trad. de Pline</i>, tom. vi. p. 444.) This supposition is improbable,
  for the gnu is an animal of Southern Africa, and was doubtless unknown to
  the Egyptians in the time of Herodotus. Moreover, Cuvier is in error as
  to the statement of Herodotus respecting the animal's size: he says that
  the animal is equal in size, not to an ass, but to the largest ox. The
  statement as to the ass is to be found in Arist. <i>Hist. An.</i>, ii. 7.
  Cuvier's note is hastily written; for he says that Diodorus describes the
  hippopotamus as equalling the strongest bulls,&mdash;a statement not to
  be found in Diodorus. (i. 35.) His judgment, however, is clear, as to the
  point that none of the ancient naturalists described the hippopotamus
  from autopsy. The writer of the accurate history of the hippopotamus in
  the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>, vol. xii. p. 247., likewise takes the same
  view. If Achilles Tatius is correct in stating that "the horse of the
  Nile" was the native Egyptian name of the animal, it is probable that the
  resemblance to the horse indicated in the description of Herodotus, was
  supplied by the imagination of some informant.</p>

  <p>In the mosaic of Palestrina (see Barthelemy in <i>Mém. de l'Acad. des
  Inscript.</i>, tom. xxx. p. 503.), the hippopotamus appears three times
  in the lower part of the composition, at the left-hand corner. Two entire
  figures are represented, and one head of an animal sinking into the
  river. Men in a boat are throwing darts at them, some of which are
  sticking in their backs. (See <i>Ib.</i> p. 521.) Diodorus (i. 35.)
  describes the hippopotamus as being harpooned, and caught in a manner
  similar to the whale. Barthelemy properly rejects the supposition that
  the mosaic of Palestrina is the one alluded to by Pliny (<i>Hist.
  Nat.</i> xxxvi. 64.) as having been constructed by Sylla. He places it in
  the time of Hadrian, and supposes it to represent a district of Upper
  Egypt, with which the introduction of the hippopotamus well accords. The
  true form of the hippopotamus was unknown in Italy in the time of
  Sylla.</p>

  <p>The word <span title="hippopotamos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F31;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&pi;&#x1F79;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  as used by the Latin writers, instead of <span title="hippos potamios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F35;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &pi;&omicron;&tau;&#x1F71;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> occurs in
  Lucian (<i>Rhet. Præcept.</i>, c. 6.). The author of the
  <i>Cynegetica</i>, who addresses his poem to the Emperor Caracalla,
  describes the hippopotamus under the name of <span title="hippagros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F35;&pi;&pi;&alpha;&gamma;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, "the wild
  horse," compounded like <span title="onagros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F44;&nu;&alpha;&gamma;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (iii. 251-61.).
  In this passage the old error as to the cloven hoofs and the mane is
  repeated. It is added that the animal will not endure captivity; but if
  any one is snared by means of ropes, he refuses to eat or drink. That
  this latter statement is fabulous, is proved by the hippopotamus taken
  alive to Constantinople, and by the very tame animal now in the
  Zoological Garden.</p>

  <p>The fable about the hippopotamus destroying its father and violating
  its mother, cited before from Damascius, is to be found in Plutarch,
  <i>De Solert. Anim.</i>, c. 4. Pausan. (viii. 46. § 4.) mentions a Greek
  statue, in which the face was made of the teeth of the hippopotamus
  instead of ivory.</p>

  <p>An interesting account of the younger hippopotamus in the Zoological
  Garden, by Professor Owen, may be seen in the <i>Annals and Magazine of
  Natural History</i> for June last.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE AND THE OLD ENGLISH ACTORS IN
GERMANY.</h3>

  <p>My studies on the first appearance of Shakspeare on the German stage,
  by means of the so-called "English Comedians" who from the end of the
  sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century visited Germany and
  the Netherlands, led me to the following passage of a Dutch author:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the Voyages of Vincent le Blanc through England, I met with a
  description of the representation of a most absurd tragedy, which I
  recognised to be the <i>Titus Andronicus</i> of Shakspeare."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have examined the <i>Voyages of Vincent le Blanc</i> without having
  been able to discover the passage alluded to; and as the Dutch author
  says that some time had elapsed between his first reading those
  <i>Voyages</i> and the composition of his treatise, and as he seems to
  quote only from memory, I am led to believe his having confounded Vincent
  le Blanc with some other traveller of the same period.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly one of your numerous readers can furnish me with the title
  of the work in which such a description occurs, or with the name of some
  other foreign traveller who may have visited England at the period
  alluded to, and in whose works I may find the description mentioned
  above.</p>

<h3>TEN CHILDREN AT A BIRTH.</h3>

  <p>The following circumstance, although perhaps hardly coming within the
  ordinary scope of the "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>,"
  appears to me too curious to allow a slight doubt to prevent the attempt
  to place it on permanent and accessible record. Chancing, the other day,
  to overhear an ancient gossip say that there was living in her
  neighbourhood a woman who was one of <i>ten</i> children born at the same
  time, I laughed at her for her credulity,&mdash;as well I might! As,
  however, she mentioned a name and place where I might satisfy myself, I
  called the next day at a small greengrocer's shop in this town, the
  mistress of which, a good-looking, respectable woman, aged seventy, at
  once assured me that her mother, whose name was Birch, and came from
  Derby, had been delivered of <i>ten children</i>; my informant having
  been the only one that lived, "<i>the other nine</i>," she added,
  "<i>being in bottle in the Museum in London</i>!" On mentioning the
  matter to a respectable professional gentleman of this place, he said "he
  had a recollection of the existence of a glass jar, which was alleged to
  contain some such preparation, in the Museum of the Royal College of
  Surgeons, as mentioned when he was a pupil in London." Of the question,
  or the fact, of so marvellous a gestation and survivorship in the history
  of human nature should strike the editor of "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" as forcibly as his correspondent, the former, should he
  publish this article, may perhaps be kind enough to accompany it with the
  result of at least an inquiry, as to whether or not the Museum of the
  Royal College of Surgeons does contain anything like corroborative
  evidence of so strange, and, if true, surely so unprecedented a
  phenomenon.</p>

  <p class="author">N.&nbsp;D.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We are enabled by the courtesy of Professor Owen to state that there
  exists no corroboration of this remarkable statement in the Museum of the
  College of Surgeons. The largest number at a birth, of which any
  authentic record appears, is five, and the Museum contains, in case No.
  3681, five children, of about five months, all females, which were born
  at the same time. Three were still-born, two were born alive, and
  survived their birth but a short time. The mother, Margaret Waddington,
  aged twenty-one, was a poor woman of the township of Lower Darling, near
  Blackburn in Lancashire. This remarkable birth took place on the 24th
  April, 1786, and was the subject of a communication to the Royal Society,
  which contained also the result of an investigation into similar cases
  which could be well authenticated, and which may be seen in a note in the
  admirable Catalogue of the College Museum, vol. v. pp. 177-185. As the
  remarkable birth described by our correspondent N.&nbsp;D. took place five
  years previously to these inquiries, and is not mentioned, it is scarcely
  possible to doubt that his informant must be labouring under some great
  mistake. If such a birth took place, it is probable that the parish
  register will contain some record of the fact. Our correspondent will,
  perhaps, take the trouble to make some further investigations, so as to
  trace the source of the error, for error there must be, in the statement
  of his informant.]</p>

<h3>GEORGE HERBERT AND BEMERTON CHURCH.</h3>

  <p>It is gratifying to see that some of your correspondents are taking,
  an interest in the "worthy, lowly, and lovely" (as Isaac Walton called
  him) Mr. George Herbert (Vol. ii., pp. 103. 414.). It may tend to
  increase that interest, if I send you a note I made a few years ago, when
  I visited Bemerton, and had the pleasure of officiating within the walls
  of that celebrated little church. The rector kindly showed me the whole
  Parsonage House; the parts rebuilt by Herbert were traceable; but the
  inscription set up by him on that occasion is not there, nor had it been
  found, viz.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2hg3">"<span class="scac">TO MY SUCCESSOR.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If thou chance for to find,</p>
      <p>A new house to thy mind,</p>
      <p class="i1">And built without thy cost;</p>
      <p>Be good to the poor,</p>
      <p>As God gives the store,</p>
      <p class="i1">And then my labour's not lost."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It may truly be said to stand near the chapel (as his biographer calls
  it), being distant only the width of the road, thirty-four feet, which in
  Herbert's time was forty feet, as the building shows. On the south is a
  grass-plat sloping down to the river, whence is a beautiful view of Sarum
  Cathedral in the distance. A very aged fig-tree grows against the end of
  the house, and a medlar in the garden, both, traditionally, planted by
  Herbert.</p>

  <p>The whole length and breadth of the church is forty-five feet by
  eighteen. The south and west windows are of the date called Decorated,
  say 1300. They are two-light windows, and worthy of imitation. The east
  window is modern. The walls have much new brickwork and brick buttresses,
  after the manner recommended in certain <i>Hints to Churchwardens</i>,
  Lond. 1825. A little square western turret contains an ancient bell of
  the fourteenth century (diameter, twenty-four inches), the daily sound of
  which used to charm the ploughmen from their work, that they "might offer
  their devotions to God with him."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Note, it was a saying of his 'That his time spent in prayer and
  cathedral music elevated his soul, and was his heaven upon
  earth.'"&mdash;<span class="sc">Walton</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The doorway is Jacobean, as is the chest or parish coffer, and also
  the pulpit canopy; the old sittings had long been removed. The font is
  circular, of early English date, lined with lead, seventeen inches
  diameter, by ten inches deep. The walls were (1841) very dilapidated.</p>

  <p>It cannot but be a surprise to every admirer of George Herbert and to
  all visitors to this highly favoured spot, to find no monument whatever
  to the memory of that bright example of an English parish priest. This
  fact need surely only to be made known to insure ample funds for
  rebuilding the little church, and "beautifying" it in all things as
  Herbert would desire (he once did it "at his own cost"), retaining, if I
  may be allowed to suggest, the decorated windows, with the font and bell,
  which, from my Notes and Recollections, seem to be all that remains of
  what he must have so often looked upon and cherished.</p>

  <p>From the register I was permitted to extract this entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. George Herbert, Esq., Parson, of Ffoughlston and Bemerton, was
  buried 3 day of March, 1632."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>locus in quo</i> is by this still left doubtful. May I, in
  conclusion, add a quotation from Isaac Walton:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He lived and died like a saint, unspotted from the world, full of
  alms deeds, full of humility, and all the examples of a virtuous life. 'I
  wish (if God shall be so pleased) that I may be so happy as to die like
  him.'"</p>

  the Terryfications (though not by Terry) of Scott's <i>Rob Roy</i> having
  made a formal affidavit that he was a real "Edinburgh Gutter Bluid," we
  suspect some of our readers themselves suspected a joke. The affidavit
  itself has, however, been printed in the <i>Athenæum</i>, accompanied by
  an amusing commentary, in which the document is justly pronounced "a very
  curious one." Here it is:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  hundred and fifty years.</p>

  <p>"In presence of John Stoddart, Esq., one of Her Majesty's Justices of

  Theatre Royal, residing at number eleven Drummond Street, Edinburgh; who
  being solemnly sworn and examined depones, that he is a native of
  Edinburgh, having been born in one of the houses on the north side of the
  High Street of said city, in the month of October one thousand seven
  hundred and eighty-seven. That the deponent left Edinburgh for Glasgow
  when only about nine years of age, where he sojourned for five years;
  thence he became a wanderer in many lands, and finally settled once more
  in Edinburgh a few months before February eighteen hundred and nineteen
  years, when the drama of <i>Rob Roy</i> was first produced in the Theatre
  Royal here. That the deponent by his own industry having realised a small
  competency, he is now residing in Edinburgh; and although upwards of
  threescore years old he finds himself 'hale and hearty,' and is one of
  the same class whom King Jamie denominates '<i>a real Edinburgh Gutter
  Bluid.</i>' All which is truth, as the deponent shall answer to God.</p>

  <p><i>Hogs not Pigs</i> (Vol. ii., p. 102.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">J.&nbsp;Mn.</span>'s remark on "hogs, lambs a year old," reminds me
  that the origin of this rustical word still lingers in the remote west,
  among the Irish and the Highland Gaels, whose <i>gnath-bearla</i>,
  vernacular tongue, furnishes the neglected key of many a dark chamber.
  The word to which I allude is "og," <i>adj.</i> young; whence "ogan," a
  young man; "oige," a virgin.</p>

  <p>In these islands we still apply the old French term "aver,"
  <i>averium</i>, in Guernsey, to the hog or pig; in Jersey, to a child. In
  France "aver" denoted the animal produce or stock on a farm; and there
  were "averia lanata" likewise. Similar apparently whimsical adaptations
  of words will not shock those who are aware that "pig" in England
  properly means a little fellow of the swine species, and that "pige" in
  Norse signifies a little maid, a damsel.</p>

  <p><i>The Baptized Turk</i>.&mdash;Your correspondent CH. (Vol. ii., p.

  another convert to Christianity, which has lately fallen in my way, if he
  be not already in possession of the (almost legendary) narrative. I
  allude to a small 8vo. volume, entitled:</p>

  Rigep Dandulo, the onely son of a silk merchant in the isle of Tsio, from
  the delusions of that great Impostor Mahomet, unto the Christian
  Religion; and of his admission unto Baptism, by Mr. Gunning at
  Excester-house Chappel, the 8th of November, 1657. Drawn up by Tho.
  Warmstry, D.D., Lond. 1658."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Warmstry was Dean of Worcester. His conversion of the Turk Dandulo
  is mentioned in the <i>Lansdowne MSS.</i> (986., p. 67.), and also in the
  <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>. The narrative is dedicated to</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Right Honourable the Countess of Dorset, the Honourable the Lord
  George, and the Worshipful Philip Warwick, Esq., <i>witnesses</i> at the
  baptism of Signior Dandulo the convert."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There appears to have been "a picture of the said Dandulo in a Turkish
  habit put before it;" <!-- Page 462 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page462"></a>{462}</span>but this has been abstracted from the only
  copy I have seen.</p>

  <p>This conversion appears to have been effected by the instrumentality
  of a dream; and the Narrative contains an interesting essay of some
  length on the subject of visions, and gives an interpretation of the
  dream in question.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>GRAY.&mdash;DRYDEN.&mdash;PLAYING CARDS.</h3>

  <p>Although my question regarding Gray and Dodsley's <i>Collection of
  Poems</i> has only been half answered, and my two Queries respecting
  Dryden's <i>Absolom and Achitophel</i> and <i>Essay on Satire</i> not
  answered at all, I am not discouraged from putting interrogatories on
  other matters, in the hope that I may be more fortunate hereafter. On
  each of my former inquiries I have still a word or two to say, and I do
  not know why I should not say them now.</p>

  <p>First, as to Gray and Dodsley:&mdash;Is the epithet <i>droning</i>, or
  <i>drony</i>, in the first edition of the <i>Elegy</i>? and, as my copy
  of Dodsley's <i>Collection</i> is dated 1748, and is said (on the half
  title, preceding the whole title) to be "the <i>second</i> edition," was
  there a <i>first</i> edition in the same year, or in an earlier year, or
  was there, in fact, no <i>first</i> edition at all? This question is
  important, because several poetical productions, of undisputed
  excellence, originally made their appearance in Dodsley's
  <i>Collection</i>.</p>

  <p>Next, as to Dryden's <i>Absolom and Achitophel</i>: Is it known, or
  anywhere stated, that it was printed early in the eighteenth century as a
  penny or two-penny chap-book, and why was it so printed? Observe, too,
  that it was unaccompanied by Tate's <i>Continuation</i>, which, as far as
  a lesson to the lower orders is concerned, was of more consequence than
  Dryden's portion. It is a circumstance I did not mention, but it is,
  nevertheless, worth a Note, that in <i>The Key</i> which follows the
  Address "to the Reader," in my edition of 1708, the character of Zimri
  (which was given by Dryden himself to the Duke of Buckingham) is assigned
  to Lord Gray, who was in truth the Caleb of the performance. Is it to be
  taken that the publication of this chap-book edition is merely a proof of
  the extreme popularity of Dryden's half of the poem?</p>

  <p>My third unanswered Query referred to the <i>Essay on Satire</i>,
  commonly attributed to Lord Mulgrave and Dryden, but with which, as it
  seems to me, for reasons there assigned, Lord Mulgrave could have nothing
  to do. As a farther proof of Dryden's <i>sole authorship</i>, I may here
  add, what I have since found, that the Addendum to the first volume of
  <i>State Poems</i> consists of one thus entitled: "In opposition to Mr.
  Dryden's <i>Essay on Satyr</i>," treating it as only his: it begins,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now the reformer of the court and stage,</p>
      <p>The common beadle of this wilful age,</p>
      <p>Has with impartial hand whipp'd sovereign sin,</p>
      <p>In me it is but manners to begin."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It sounds drolly, in our day, to hear Dryden called "the reformer of
  the court and stage," especially recollecting the attack upon him made
  just afterwards by Jeremy Collier. Then, what are we to say to the
  subsequent lines, attributed to Prior, which advert to the cudgelling
  Dryden received in Rose Street for his attack upon Rochester. Prior calls
  his own production <i>A Satire on the Modern Translators</i>, where he
  thus speaks of Dryden under his name of Bayes:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But what excuse, what preface can atone</p>
      <p>For crimes which guilty Bayes <i>has singly done</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>Bayes, whose Rose Alley ambuscade enjoin'd</p>
      <p>To be to vices, which he practised, kind?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>All the contemporary evidence, with which I am acquainted, tends to
  establish that Lord Mulgrave, instead of being the author of a satire
  which Dryden improved and polished, had nothing in the world to do with
  it. Is there any evidence, not contemporary, which shows the contrary?
  Surely this, and the two other matters to which I have above adverted,
  are interesting literary Queries.</p>

  <p>Now to a subject that I care less about, and upon which I am entitled,
  from his published works, to appeal to your correspondent, <span
  class="sc">Mr. S. W. Singer</span>. It is a mere trifle, but upon a
  curious point&mdash;the history of playing cards, which may, however,
  attract more attention than topics that relate only to such insignificant
  men as Thomas Gray and John Dryden.</p>

  <p>I have before me only four, out of what I presume originally consisted
  of fifty-two playing cards, unlike any I have hitherto heard of. Each of
  them illustrates a proverb, which is engraved at the bottom of a
  pictorial representation of figures and objects, and the cards consist of
  the ten of diamonds, the ace of hearts, the seven of hearts, and the
  eight of spades: the number is in Roman figures at the left-hand corner,
  and the subject, a diamond, heart, and spade, at the right-hand corner. I
  will briefly describe them separately.</p>

  <p>The proverb illustrated by the ten of diamonds is "Hee's in an ill
  case y<sup>t</sup> can finde no hole to creepe out at;" and the engraving
  (upon copper) represents two men, with grey heads and in black gowns, in
  the pillory, surrounded by soldiers armed with halberds, partisans,
  spears, &amp;c., of various shapes, and by a crowd of men in dresses of
  the seventeenth century. The ace of hearts illustrates the proverb "Look
  before you leap;" a man in a hat turned up at the sides is about to leap
  from a high bank into the waters, wherein two others are already
  swimming: in the background is a fifth man looking over the fence of a
  cottage. The seven of hearts has engraved at the bottom of it, <!-- Page
  463 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page463"></a>{463}</span>"Patience
  on force is a medicine for a mad horse;" and it represents the female
  keeper of a brothel receiving whip-castigation at a cart's tail, a
  punishment frequently inflicted of old upon women of that description, as
  many authors testify: soldiers with halberds, &amp;c., as before, march
  on either side of the cart, which at the moment is passing a house with
  the sign of the Half-moon hanging out from the wall by ornamented
  iron-work. The eight of spades is upon the proverb, "Two of a trade can
  never agree;" and in the engraving, a couple of fish-wives, who have
  thrown down their baskets of plaise, flounders, &amp;c., are fighting
  furiously, while a man, behind, is obviously running away with something
  he has stolen from them: the background consists of gable-ended houses,
  part of a street.</p>

  <p>These cards came to me from an old relative, who very likely once had
  the whole pack, or <i>deck</i>, as it was formerly called; but I never
  could find more than these four, and I have been unable to meet with, or
  hear of, any others like them. From the costume and other circumstances,
  I am inclined to think that they belong to the period of the Civil War,
  or rather later; and I remember, some years ago, to have been shown
  twenty or thirty cards of the latter end of the seventeenth century,
  founded upon public events, one of them relating to the celebrated
  "Virgins of Taunton Dean," another to the Death of Monmouth, &amp;c. I
  shall be personally obliged by any information respecting the cards I
  have described; and, since a distinct Query may be desirable, I beg leave
  to ask any of your readers, whether they know of the existence of any
  other cards belonging to the same set?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Pretended Reprint of Ancient Poetry.</i>&mdash;In a bookseller's
  catalogue (J. Taylor, Blackfriars-road, 1824), I find mention of a work
  entitled <i>Sundrie Pleasaunte Flowres of Poesie, newlie plucked from the
  Hill Parnasse the hand of P.&nbsp;M., and verie goodlie to smelle</i>. It is
  said to have been "Imprynted in London, in the yeare of our Lorde 1576,"
  and "Reprinted by Davidson, 1823." The bookseller's note records the
  fact, that "only <span class="scac">TWO COPIES</span> were reprinted from
  the original supposed to be unique." I do not believe that any work with
  the above title came from the press in the sixteenth century. Query, Who
  was the enlightened individual who produced the <i>two</i> copies?</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers, acquainted with the neighbourhood of London,

  that a vessel of oblate spheroidal form&mdash;of 30 cubits in the

  acknowledged relation of the bath to the cubit) hold exactly 2,000 baths

  cemetery, that prayers and mass are said daily in a church dedicated to
  the same saint, in the south of France, for the repose of the souls of
  the faithful whose bodies are deposited in the church of St. Pancras near
  London (England), where crosses and Requiescat in Pace, or the initial of
  those words, R.I.P., are found on the sepulchral monuments. It is said
  prayer and mass <!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the same purpose.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers inform me where that church is in the south of

  <p>It is also understood that this church was the last whose bell tolled

<h3>HOLME MSS.&mdash;THE CRADOCKS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 429.).<p class="cenhead">

  <p>In answer to the Query of <span class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span>, "I
  should like to know whether the MSS. of Randle Holme, of Chester, 1670,
  which afterwards were penes Dr. Latham, are still accessible?"</p>

  <p>1. The MSS. alluded to are those of <i>four</i> successive antiquaries
  of that name, of whom an account will be found in Ormerod's <i>Hist.
  Chesh.</i>, vol. ii., under "Tranmere."</p>

  <p>2. The person intended was <i>not</i> Dr. Latham, but Mr. William
  Latham, of Eltham, afterwards of Quenby Hall, Leicestershire,
  <i>brother</i> of Dr. Latham, <i>of Romsey</i>, the naturalist.</p>

  <p>3. The Holme MSS. were <i>never</i> in the possession of Mr. Latham,
  but if <span class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span> will refer to Dr. Gower's
  prospectus, reissued by Mr. Latham in 1800, he will find a correct
  statement of their having been obtained by Bishop Gastrell for the Earl
  of Oxford, and "eventually for the mighty emolument of the public." (p.
  40.)</p>

  <p>4. These MSS. (being part of the Harleian Collection), <i>are
  accessible</i> to visitors of the reading room at the Museum, and extend,
  in the Harleian Catalogue, from No. 1920. to No. 2180. inclusive.</p>

  <p>5. With respect to <i>Cradocks</i>, as connected with Cheshire, Mr. E.
  will find notice in Ormerod's <i>Hist. Chesh.</i>, iii. 236., of the tomb
  of Sir John Cradock in Nantwich Church, as lately, and perhaps now,
  remaining, and an account of its <i>former</i> state in Chaloner's and
  Holme's <i>Church Notes</i>, Harl. MSS. 2151., and in <i>Ordinary of Arms
  in King's Vale Royall</i>, 1656, arms assigned to Cradock:&mdash;"Argent,
  on a chevron azure three garbs, or. Partridge (<i>Hist. of Nantwich</i>,
  1773) names him Sir David, and states that the arms were not <i>then</i>
  discoverable." Platt's later <i>History</i> quotes Derrick's
  <i>Letters</i> for naming him Sir Roger.</p>

  <p>The pedigree of <span class="sc">Newton</span>, previously <span
  class="sc">Cradock</span>, will be found at length in Lewys Dwnn's
  <i>Visitation of Wales</i> (vol. i. p. 145.), published by the late Sir
  Samuel Meyrick, under the auspices of the Welsh MSS. Society. It places
  Newton in Pembrokeshire, and differs in some other respects from <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe's</span> account. The entry was made in 39
  Eliz., 1597, and the close of the pedigree, translated into English, is
  as follows:</p>

<h3>ANTIQUITY OF SMOKING.</h3>

  <p>In Vol. ii., p. 286., an allusion is made by a correspondent to the

      <p class="i10">Athen I. p. 5. F.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The two last verses are thus rendered in the passage referred to:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And I will sweetly burn my throat with cuttings;</p>
      <p>A chimney, not a man."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Athenæus is describing the fondness of the ancient gourmands for
  eating their food extremely hot. As they had no forks, but, like the
  modern Orientals, carried their food to their mouth with their fingers,
  one Pithyllus used gloves in order to avoid burning his fingers.
  (<i>Ib.</i> I. p. 6. D.)</p>

  <p>In the second line there is a pun upon the word <span title="idaios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F30;&delta;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> which is
  explained to mean "cold"&mdash;the allusion being to the Idæan Dactyli.
  (See Meineke, <i>Fragm. Com. Gr.</i>, vol. iv. p. 568. Lobeck,
  <i>Aglaoph</i>. p. 1181.) The passage is to be translated thus:</p>

  <p>A. My fingers are fire-proof against these exceedingly hot morsels,
  and I delight in burning my throat with slices of fish.</p>

  <p>B. "A furnace, not a man."</p>

  <p>In v. 3. <span title="puriô" class="grk"
  >&pi;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&#x1FF6;</span> is the word properly applied to
  steaming in a vapour-bath; and <span title="temachos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&mu;&alpha;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> or <span
  title="temachôn" class="grk"
  >&tau;&epsilon;&mu;&#x1F71;&chi;&omega;&nu;</span> is a slice or cutlet
  of fish. (See Aristoph. <i>Nub.</i> 339.) In v. 4. <span title="kaminos" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F71;&mu;&iota;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> must not be
  rendered "chimney". It is a furnace or oven, and not even a stove or
  hearth, as Scott and Liddell remark in v. The ancient Greeks, and
  probably the Romans likewise, were unacquainted with chimneys. (See
  Beckmann, <i>Hist. of Inventions</i>, art. "Chimneys," and Smith's
  <i>Dict. of Greek and Rom. Ant.</i>, art. "House".) The meanings of the
  Latin word <i>caminus</i> are explained by Beckmann (<i>Ib.</i>, vol. i.
  p. 301. ed. Bohn). The short poem of <span title="kaminos ê keramis" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F71;&mu;&iota;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#x1F22;
  &kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&#x1F77;&sigmaf;</span>, attributed to
  Homer (<i>Epig.</i> 14.), illustrates the meaning of the word <span
  title="kaminos" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F71;&mu;&iota;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>. In these verses
  it is a furnace used for baking pottery.</p>

<h3>ANTIQUITAS SÆCULI JUVENTUS MUNDI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 218. 350. 295.).</p>

  <p>The aphorism, "Antiquitas sæculi juventus mundi," which occurs in the
  <i>Treatise de Augm. Scient.</i>, vol. viii. p. 39., and in the

  safely attributed to Lord Bacon himself, though it is printed in both
  passages in the form of quotation, between inverted commas.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Novum Organum</i>, lib. i. aph. 83, the thought appears in
  this form:</p>

  <p>The pointed and aphoristic form of the thought is due to Bacon; the
  thought itself has, however, been traced by Dr. Whewell to Giordano
  Bruno.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is worthy of remark, that a thought which is often quoted from
  Francis Bacon, occurs in Bruno's <i>Cena di Cenere</i>, published in
  1584; I mean the notion, that the later times are more aged than the
  earlier. In the course of the dialogue, the Pedant, who is one of the
  interlocutors, says, 'In antiquity is wisdom;' to which the philosophical
  character replies, 'If you knew what you were talking about, you would
  see that your principle leads to the opposite result of that which you
  wish to infer; I mean, that <i>we</i> are older and have lived longer
  than our predecessors.' He then proceeds to apply this, by tracing the
  course of astronomy through the earlier astronomers up to
  Copernicus."&mdash;<i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 361.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>Advancement of Learning</i> was published in 1605, twenty-one
  years after the Treatise of Bruno. Mr. Hallam (<i>History of Europe</i>,
  vol. iv. p. 92.) treats the thought as the original property of Bacon;
  and although the first trace of it is to be found in Bruno, there is no
  improbability in supposing that it occurred independently to Bacon about
  the same time.</p>

  <p><i>Bacon's Advancement in Learning</i> (Vol. ii., p. 396.).&mdash;The
  writer in "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" speaks of the
  English text as being original, and the Latin a version of Lord Bacon's
  <i>Instauratio Magna</i>; is he not mistaken? In reality there were two
  originals of that work, as we learn from Mallet's account prefixed to the
  folio edition of Bacon's works in 4 vols. London, 1740, p. xvii. et seq.
  (vol. first). The first edition was in English, London, 1605, and is to
  be found in the Bodleian. The Latin, published in 1623, is said by Mallet
  to be the work of Bacon himself, with the assistance of some friends,
  after he had enlarged and corrected the original; it is from this that
  Wats' version is made, which is very exact and faithful to its original.
  The title-page is engraved on copper by Marshall, with this
  inscription:</p>

  <p>The passage referred to is at p. 36.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Indeed, to speak truly, <i>Antiquitas seculi juventus mundi</i>,
  certainly our times are the ancient times, when the world is now ancient,
  and not those which we count ancient, <i>ordine retrogrado</i>, by a
  computation backward from our own times."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now this agrees exactly with Bacon's original Latin in Mallet's
  edition, vol. i. p. 43., except that ordine retrogrado is not in Italics;
  but in Bacon's English text (Mallet's edition, vol ii. p. 431.), the
  coincidence in all respects is complete:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And to speak truly, Antiquitas sacculi, (<i>sic</i>) juventus mundi.

  those which we account ancient <i>ordine retrogrado</i>, by a computation

<h3>ALBEMARLE, TITLE OF.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 442.).</p>

  <p>In reply to the question of J., I send you some particulars about
  <i>Aumerle</i> or Albemarle.</p>

  <p>The first Earl of this place, which is the name of a small town or
  territory in Normandy, was Otho, descended from the Earls of Champagne,
  and nearly related to William the Conqueror, to whom he fled for
  protection, having killed a great person in that country, and obtained
  this earldom and the Isle of Holderness, in Yorkshire, for his
  maintenance. The title remained in the heirs of Otho till the death of
  William, eighth Earl of Albemarle, 44th Henry III., when it reverted to
  the Crown, with the lordship of Holderness, and in the 9th of Richard II.
  he granted them to Thomas of Woodstock, summoned to parliament as
  "Thomas, Duke of Albemarle, the king's loving uncle."</p>

  <p>Without enumerating the different persons upon whom our kings
  subsequently conferred this title as often as it became extinct or
  vacant, it will be sufficient for our purpose to show, that at the
  Restoration the dukedom of Albemarle was given to General Monk, who,
  according to Banks (<i>D. and E. Peerage</i>, vol. iii. p. 37.), had a
  certain degree of hereditary pretension to the name <!-- Page 467
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page467"></a>{467}</span>by which he
  was ennobled, inasmuch as he was descended from Margaret, eldest daughter
  and co-heir of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick and Albemarle; but this
  is not satisfactorily made out in Banks' table. At all events, the
  dukedom became again extinct on the death of Christopher Monk, the second
  Duke of Albemarle, in 1688, S.P.; but the name was once more revived in
  1695-6, by William III., in favour of Arnold Joort Van Keppel, Lord of
  Voorst, who had attended the king in several campaigns, and was his
  Master of the Robes, and on the 10th of February in that year created
  "<i>Earl of Albemarle in Normandy</i>;" the title having been doubtless
  selected as one so frequently enjoyed by persons of the highest
  consideration, and not in any way resting upon an hereditary claim.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Cromwell Poisoned</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  P. T. queries if there be any other statement than that which he adduces
  respecting Cromwell having been poisoned. I would refer him to the
  <i>Athenæ Oxoniensis</i> of Anthony à Wood, vol. ii. p. 303.,<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in which it is
  stated that Dr. George Bate's friends gave him credit for having given a
  baneful dose to the Protector, to ingratiate himself with Charles II.
  Amidst all the mutations of those changeful times, and whether Charles
  I., Cromwell, or Charles II. were in the ascendant, Dr. George Bate
  always contrived to be the chief state physician. In Whitelock's
  <i>Memorials of the English Affairs</i> (1732), p. 494, it appears that
  the Parliament, in 1651, ordered Dr. Bate to go into Scotland to attend
  the General (Cromwell), and to take care of his health; he being his
  usual physician in London, and well esteemed by him. He wrote a work
  styled <i>Elenchus Motuum nuperorum in Angliâ</i>. This was severely
  scrutinised in another, entitled <i>Elenchus Elenchi; sive
  Animadversiones in Georgii Batei, Cromwelli Paricidæ, aliquando
  Protomedici, Elenchi Motuum nuperorum in Angliâ. Autore Robt. Pugh;
  Parisiis, 1664</i>.</p>

  <p>Dr. Bate, who died 19th April, 1669, was buried at Kingston upon
  Thames.</p>

  <p><i>First Earl of Roscommon</i> (Vol. ii., p. 325.).&mdash;There was,

  ago, an old tombstone belonging to the Dillon Family, on which was traced
  the genealogy of the Roscommon branch from one of the sons of the first
  earl (if I remember right, the third or fourth), down to a Thomas, who
  had, I have heard my father say, a son called Garrett, who had issue two
  sons, Patrick and Thomas. Patrick was always, in that part of the
  country, <i>considered the heir</i> to this title. Patrick and Thomas had
  issue, (living or dead I know not), but should imagine dead; as, had they
  been living, they would no doubt have come forward when the late earl
  claimed the title, as he claimed it as being descended from the youngest
  son of the first earl, whereas Patrick and Thomas were certainly the
  descendants of one of the elder sons of the first earl; and therefore,
  had the sons of either Patrick or Thomas come forward, it would no doubt
  have been decided in their favour. On this account, it was several years
  before the late earl's claim was fully confirmed, as it was thought that
  some of the descendants of the elder branches might come forward. This
  would have attracted my attention earlier had I not been abroad.</p>

  <p><i>Becket</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 106. 270. 364.).&mdash;It so happens
  that, before seeing, <span class="sc">Mr. Venables'</span> communication,
  with his quotations from the <i>Monasticon</i> (Vol. ii., p. 364), I had
  taken an opportunity of looking into a friend's copy of that work, and
  had there found what seems to be a key to the origin of the designation
  "<i>St. Thomas of Acon</i> or <i>Acres</i>." It is stated, in a quotation
  from Bp. Tanner, that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The hospital [in Cheapside] consisted of a master and several
  brethren, professing the rule of St. Austin, but were of a particular
  order, which was about this time instituted in the Holy Land, viz.
  <i>Militiæ Hospitales S. Thomæ Martyris Cantuariensis de Acon</i>, being
  a branch of the Templars."&mdash;<i>Monast.</i> vi. 646.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and the same title occurs in the charter of Edward III. (<i>ibid.</i>)
  Now it appears to me that the words <i>de Acon</i> here relate, not to
  the saint, but to the order which took its name from him; and this view
  is confirmed by the passage which Mr. <span class="sc">Venables</span>
  quotes from <i>Matthew of Westminster</i>, as to the foundation of a
  chapel in honour of St. Thomas, at Acre, in Syria, <span class="scac">A.
  D.</span> 1190. It is easy to suppose that in course of time, especially
  when the origin of the designation had been cast into the shade by the
  cessation of the Crusades, and the ruin of the great order to which the
  brethren of St. Thomas were at first attached, the patron himself may
  have come to be styled <i>de Acon</i> or <i>of Acres</i>: and this seems
  to be the case in the Act of 23 Hen. VI. (<i>Monast.</i> vi. 247.)</p>

  <p>Allow me to ask a question as to another point in the history of
  Becket. Among his preferments is said to have been the parish of "St.
  Mary <i>Littory</i> or <i>ad Litters</i>," which is commonly supposed to
  mean St. Mary-le-Strand.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> My friend Mr. Foss, in his elaborate
  work on <i>The Judges of England</i>, contradicts this, on the ground
  that there was then no parish of that name; and he supposes St.
  Mary-at-Hill to be intended. Now the words <i>ad Litters</i> would be
  alike applicable as a description in either case but it appears to me
  that, if the city church were meant, it would be styled, as it usually
  is, <i>ad Montem</i>, and that <i>ad Litters</i> is Latin for <i>le
  Strand</i>. Was there not then an ancient church so called, until the
  demolitions of Protector Somerset in that quarter? And is not the common
  belief as to Becket's parish correct? I ask in great ignorance, but not
  without having vainly searched some books from which information might
  have been expected.</p>

  <p><i>Kilt</i> (Vol. ii., p. 62.).&mdash;Your correspondent <span
  class="grk">&Sigma;</span>. will find some information regarding the
  introduction of the <i>kilt</i> into Scotland in a volume entitled
  <i>Notes to assist the Memory in various Sciences</i>, 2d edition,
  London, Murray, 1827. I quote the passage, p. 297.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>The Pheliebeg.</i> Thomas Rawlinson, an iron-smelter and an
  Englishman, was the person who, about or prior to <span class="scac">A.
  D.</span> 1728, introduced the pheliebeg, or short kilt, worn in the
  Highlands. This fact, very little known, is established in a letter from
  Ewan Baillie, of Oberiachan, inserted in the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>
  for 1785, and also by the Culloden Papers."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The writer of that work, and of that <i>daring</i> statement, was, I
  have been informed, a Scottish military gentleman of the name of
  Hamilton. This origin of the kilt is also mentioned by Mr. Robert
  Chambers in his <i>Life of Duncan Forbes, of Culloden</i>. See his
  <i>Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Scotus Secundus</span>.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh, Nov. 22.</p>

  <p><i>Bacon Family</i> (Vol. ii., p. 247.).&mdash;The origin, of this
  surname is to be found, I conceive, in the word <i>Beacon</i>. The man
  who had the care of the <i>Beacon</i> would be called <i>John</i> or
  <i>Roger of the Beacon. Beacon Hill</i>, near Newark, is pronounced in
  that locality as if spelt <i>Bacon Hill</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Mariner's Compass</i> (Vol. ii., p. 56.).&mdash;The "fleur de lis"
  was made the ornament of the northern radius of the mariner's compass in
  compliment to Charles of Anjou (whose device it was), the reigning king
  of Sicily, at the time when Flavio Gioja, the Neapolitan, first employed
  that instrument in navigation.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Bohn has just issued a new volume of his Antiquarian Library; and
  we shall be greatly surprised if it does not prove one of the most
  popular of the whole series. It is a new and greatly enlarged edition of
  Mr. Keightley's <i>Fairy Mythology illustrative of the Romance and
  Superstition of various Countries</i>, a work characterised alike by a
  quick perception of the beauty of the popular myths recorded in its
  pages, the good taste manifested in their selection, and the learning and
  scholarship with which Mr. Keightley has illustrated them. The lovers of
  folk-lore will be delighted with this new edition of a book, which such
  men as Goethe, Grimm, Von Hammer, Douce, and Southey have agreed in
  commending; and of which the appearance is particularly well timed, for a
  fitter book for fire-side reading, or a Christmas present, we know not
  than this edition of Keightley's <i>Fairy Mythology</i>, with its
  inimitable frontispiece by George Cruikshank, which alone is worth the
  price of the volume.</p>

  <p>Whitaker's <i>Clergyman's Diary and Ecclesiastical Calendar</i> is
  intended to supply a want which is acknowledged to have been long felt by
  the clergy, though the lawyer and man of business have been for many
  years well supplied with works of a similar character. A glance at the
  Table of Contents shows how much valuable matter, of especial interest to
  our clerical friends, has here been collected from various sources for
  their information; and to prove the value of a work destined, we have no
  doubt, to find for many years an extensive and well-deserved
  patronage.</p>

  <p>Few of our readers but have tested and found the value of Mrs. Cowden
  Clarke's <i>Concordance to Shakspeare</i>; and few are the nurseries into
  which some of her clever and kindly books for children have not found
  their way; so that albeit her projected series of tales, <i>The Girlhood
  of Shakspeare's Heroines</i>, scarcely belongs to the class of works
  usually noticed in our columns, we gladly find in Mrs. Clarke's love of
  children and reverence for Shakspeare, an excuse for saying a few words
  in favour of her good work of tracing the probable antecedents in the
  history of some of Shakspeare's heroines.</p>

  <p>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CONTROVERSY.&mdash;At the present crisis, when the
  extraordinary aggression of Pope Pius IX. on the rights of the Church and
  Sovereign of England renders a thorough acquaintance with the Roman
  Catholic Controversy most essential, the Council of the PARKER SOCIETY
  are desirous of calling public attention to the WORKS of the REFORMERS
  which they have issued.</p>

  <p>These are the writings of Archbishop Cranmer, two vols.; Bishop
  Ridley, Latimer, two vols.; Coverdale, two vols.; Jewel, three vols.
  completed, the fourth nearly ready; also those of Tyndale, three vols.;
  Becon, three vols., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The annual subscription to the Society is 1<i>l.</i>, to be paid in
  advance, for which each member receives four volumes. In the concluding
  volume of Bishop Jewel's works will appear, among other treatises, his
  "View of a Seditious Bull," being that issued by Pius V. against Queen
  Elizabeth. The republication of this will be felt to be most seasonable
  at the present time, and the complete answers furnished by the Romanisers
  to all the Romish doctrines and assumptions will be found of the greatest
  interest and use.</p>

  <p>The Council are anxious to facilitate as far as possible the desire of
  the Clergy and others to possess these important works; and as they have
  on hand copies of some of the authors named, they are prepared to dispose
  of these on reasonable terms. Application may be made to W. Thomas, Esq.,
  33. Southampton Street, Strand.</p>

  <p>It is particularly requested that the members will pay their
  subscriptions for 1851 as early as possible. As the series of
  publications is is now drawing to a close, this announcement is
  important, and the Council will feel greatly obliged by attention to
  it.</p>
